# This lesson covers Python Modules

- Python Library and built in functions
- What is pip and how we use it?
- APIs within Python

- Built in functions help accelerate our development of software


- How can we create a customised method and utilise the built in functionality at the same time
- When and why should we do that
```
def current_system_path():
    print(f"this is your current directory \n {sys.path}")
current_system_path()

```


**What is pip?**
- Package manager for Python
- Helps us install external packages e.g requests

- Syntax: pip install <package_name>

# Requests
- Requests help us manage API (Application Programming Interfaces)
- http and https are protocols that are used to send, receive, interact with data that is live on the web
- success code 200 : site is live
